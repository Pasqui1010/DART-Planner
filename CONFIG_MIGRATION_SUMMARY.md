# Configuration System Migration Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The migration from the legacy `dart_planner.config.settings` module to the new `dart_planner.config.frozen_config` system has been completed successfully.

## What Was Migrated

### ✅ Completed Changes

1. **Legacy Module Removal**
   - Deleted `src/dart_planner/config/settings.py` (legacy shim)
   - All imports now use `dart_planner.config.frozen_config`

2. **Test Updates**
   - Updated `tests/test_timing_alignment.py` to use new config module
   - Updated `tests/test_frozen_config_api.py` to verify legacy module is gone

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated this migration summary
   - All references to legacy config system removed

## Migration Results

### Before Migration
- Legacy `settings.py` module with global state
- Inconsistent configuration access patterns
- No type safety for configuration values

### After Migration
- ✅ `frozen_config` module with immutable configuration
- ✅ Type-safe configuration access with Pydantic validation
- ✅ Centralized configuration management
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration support
- ✅ All legacy references removed

## Verification

The migration is verified by:
- ✅ All tests pass with new configuration system
- ✅ No remaining imports of legacy `settings` module
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline uses new configuration system
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect new system

## Next Steps

The configuration system is now ready for advanced features. No further migration work is needed.
