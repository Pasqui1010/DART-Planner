## **🌟 Value Proposition Messaging**

### **For Professional Developers**
> *"Finally, a drone autonomy system that works without fighting research-grade code."*

**Key Pain Points You Solve:**
- ❌ **Algorithm Mismatches**: No more ground robot controllers in aerial systems
- ❌ **Cloud Dependencies**: No more "hover and pray" when connectivity fails
- ❌ **Neural Uncertainty**: No more waiting for neural magic oracles to converge
- ❌ **Code Quality Issues**: No more dealing with research-grade software engineering

### **For Academic Researchers**
> *"A reliable baseline for autonomous drone research with audit-proven algorithms."*

**Research Value:**
- ✅ **Reproducible Results**: Deterministic algorithms, not random neural outcomes
- ✅ **Proper Benchmarking**: Compare against production-ready baseline
- ✅ **Educational Value**: Learn from professional software engineering practices
- ✅ **Extension Platform**: Build advanced research on solid foundation

### **Launch Post Templates**

#### **Reddit/HackerNews**
```
Title: "DART-Planner: Open source drone autonomy that actually works in production"

Body: "After implementing a technical audit that identified 4 critical flaws in
research-grade drone systems, I built DART-Planner - the first autonomous drone
stack designed like production software.

Key improvements:
- SE(3) MPC instead of misapplied ground robot controllers
- Explicit geometric mapping instead of unreliable neural oracles
- Edge-first architecture instead of cloud dependency
- Professional software engineering from day one

Try the demo: docker run -p 8080:8080 dartplanner/simulation"
```

#### **LinkedIn Professional**
```
"🚁 After 6 months of engineering work, I'm excited to open source DART-Planner -
a production-ready autonomous drone navigation system.

The project started with a technical audit that revealed why most academic drone
software fails in real-world conditions. DART-Planner addresses these issues with:

✅ Proper aerial robotics algorithms (SE(3) MPC)
✅ Deterministic perception (explicit geometric mapping)
✅ Edge-first autonomous operation (no cloud dependency)
✅ Professional software engineering practices

This represents a shift from research experiments to engineering solutions.

Demo: [GitHub link] | Try: docker run -p 8080:8080 dartplanner/simulation"
