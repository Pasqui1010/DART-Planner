## Engineering Analysis

### Root Cause Assessment

**Hypothesis 1: Simulation Model Issues**
- Physics simulation may not accurately represent real system dynamics
- Integration step size vs control frequency mismatch
- Numerical instability in simulation at high frequencies

**Hypothesis 2: Control Algorithm Design**
- Geometric controller may have inherent stability limitations
- Gain values may be inappropriate for system characteristics
- PID structure may not be suitable for this application

**Hypothesis 3: System Parameter Mismatch**
- Physical parameters (mass, inertia, etc.) may be incorrect
- Environmental assumptions (no disturbances) unrealistic
- Actuator dynamics not properly modeled

### Performance Trade-offs Discovered

**Computational vs Control Performance**:
- Excellent computational optimization achieved
- Control stability severely compromised
- Classic engineering trade-off: frequency vs stability

**Optimization vs Robustness**:
- Phase 1 gains worked in specific conditions
- Higher gains amplify system instabilities
- Aggressive optimization reduces robustness margins

## Key Technical Insights

1. **Control frequency is not the limiting factor** - System unstable even at 100Hz
2. **Computational optimization succeeded perfectly** - All targets exceeded
3. **Phase 1 performance was likely situational** - Specific test conditions favorable
