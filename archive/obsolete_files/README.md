## Accessing Archived Files

If you need to reference any of these files:
1. They are preserved in this archive directory
2. They contain historical context and implementation details
3. They can be referenced for understanding the project's evolution

## Important Note

These files were archived because they are:
- **Temporary**: Created during development/cleanup process
- **Redundant**: Information is now in permanent documentation
- **Obsolete**: Superseded by current implementation
- **Generated**: Can be recreated if needed

The core project functionality and documentation remain intact in the main repository.
