# Dependency Injection Migration Guide

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The migration from the legacy `dart_planner.common.di_container` module to the new `dart_planner.common.di_container_v2` system has been completed successfully.

## What Was Migrated

### ✅ Completed Changes

1. **Legacy Module Removal**
   - Deleted `src/dart_planner/common/di_container.py` (legacy shim)
   - All imports now use `dart_planner.common.di_container_v2`

2. **Import Updates**
   - Updated `src/hardware/pixhawk_interface.py` to use new DI module
   - All other files already migrated to `di_container_v2`

3. **Test Updates**
   - All tests use `di_container_v2` module
   - Legacy shim tests updated to verify migration completion

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated this migration guide
   - All references to legacy DI system removed

## Migration Results

### Before Migration
- Legacy `di_container.py` module with basic DI functionality
- Inconsistent dependency injection patterns
- Limited lifecycle management

### After Migration
- ✅ `di_container_v2` module with advanced DI features
- ✅ Staged registration (bootstrap, runtime, dynamic)
- ✅ Lifecycle management and validation
- ✅ All legacy references removed

## Verification

The migration is verified by:
- ✅ All tests pass with new DI system
- ✅ No remaining imports of legacy `di_container` module
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline uses new DI system
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect new system

## Next Steps

The dependency injection system is now ready for advanced features. No further migration work is needed.
