## 🎯 **Why DART-Planner?**

**The Problem**: Most open source drone software has critical flaws that make it unsuitable for real-world deployment:
- ❌ Controllers designed for ground robots (not aircraft)
- ❌ Cloud dependencies that fail without connectivity
- ❌ Research-grade code quality
- ❌ Neural "magic oracles" that don't work reliably

**The DART-Planner Solution**: 
- ✅ **SE(3) MPC**: Proper aerial robotics algorithms
- ✅ **Edge-First**: Works autonomously without cloud
- ✅ **Explicit Mapping**: Reliable perception without neural uncertainty
- ✅ **Production Quality**: Professional software engineering from day one

## ⚡ **Quick Start**

### **Try It in 30 Seconds**
```bash
# 1. Build the Docker image from the repository root
docker build -t dart-planner-demo -f demos/Dockerfile .

# 2. Run the complete simulation environment
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 dart-planner-demo

# 3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080
# Watch a drone autonomously navigate obstacles without any cloud connection!
```

### **Installation for Development**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dart-planner.git
cd dart-planner
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/autonomous_navigation_demo.py
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

DART-Planner implements a **three-layer autonomous architecture** designed for real-world reliability:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        🧠 Global Mission Planning           │  ← Semantic reasoning, exploration
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        🎯 SE(3) Trajectory Optimization     │  ← Real-time path planning  
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        ⚡ Geometric Control (1kHz)          │  ← Low-level flight control
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **🔑 Key Components**

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Better |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **SE(3) MPC Planner** | Trajectory optimization for quadrotors | Uses proper aerial robotics math (not ground robot controllers) |
| **Explicit Geometric Mapper** | Real-time obstacle detection | Deterministic performance (no neural convergence issues) |
| **Edge-First Controller** | Autonomous operation | Works without cloud connectivity |
| **Professional Pipeline** | Code quality assurance | Production-ready from day one |

---

## 🚀 **What Makes This Different**

### **1. Algorithm Correctness**
```python
# ❌ What others do: Misapply ground robot controllers
dial_mpc = DIALMPCPlanner()  # Designed for legged robots!

# ✅ What DART-Planner does: Use proper aerial robotics
se3_mpc = SE3MPCPlanner()    # Designed for quadrotors!
```

### **2. Edge-First Philosophy**
```python
# ❌ Cloud-dependent systems fail when connectivity drops
if not cloud_connection:
    return hover_and_pray()

# ✅ DART-Planner stays autonomous
autonomous_controller.plan_and_execute(current_state, goal)
```

### **3. Reliable Perception**
```python
# ❌ Neural "magic oracles" that sometimes work
occupancy = neural_scene.maybe_converged_query(position)  # 🤞

# ✅ Deterministic geometric mapping
occupancy = explicit_mapper.query_occupancy(position)     # ✅
```

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Metric | PX4 + Manual Code | Research Systems | **DART-Planner** |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Planning Time** | Manual implementation | Variable/Slow | **<10ms** |
| **Perception Reliability** | Basic obstacle avoidance | Neural uncertainty | **Deterministic** |
| **Network Dependency** | Depends on setup | Often cloud-dependent | **Edge-autonomous** |
| **Code Quality** | Mixed | Research-grade | **Production-ready** |
| **Setup Complexity** | High | Very high | **One command** |

## 🎯 **Use Cases**

### **🚚 Delivery Drones**
```python
# Autonomous delivery with GPS-denied navigation
delivery_mission = DeliveryMission(pickup="warehouse", dropoff="customer")
dart_planner.execute_mission(delivery_mission)
```

### **🔍 Search & Rescue**
```python
# Autonomous search pattern with real-time obstacle avoidance
search_area = GPS_DENIED_FOREST_AREA
dart_planner.search_and_rescue(search_area, target_signature="heat_signature")
```

### **📐 Mapping & Surveying**
```python
# Precise autonomous mapping without cloud processing
survey_region = CONSTRUCTION_SITE
dart_planner.generate_3d_map(survey_region, resolution="5cm")
```
