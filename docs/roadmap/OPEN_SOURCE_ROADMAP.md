# 🚀 DART-Planner Open Source Strategy

## **Vision Statement**
"Provide the drone development community with a robust, production-ready autonomous flight system that eliminates the common pitfalls of research-grade implementations."

---

## **🎯 Market Positioning**

### **The Problem We Solve**
Current open source drone software has critical gaps:

1. **Research-Production Gap**: Most systems are academic proofs-of-concept
2. **Algorithm Mismatches**: Controllers designed for other domains (ground robots)
3. **Cloud Dependencies**: Systems that fail without connectivity
4. **Poor Software Quality**: Lack of professional engineering practices

### **Our Solution: DART-Planner**
- ✅ **Production-Ready Architecture**: Edge-first autonomous operation
- ✅ **Proper Algorithms**: SE(3) MPC designed for aerial robotics
- ✅ **Reliable Perception**: Explicit geometric mapping (no neural magic)
- ✅ **Professional Quality**: Type safety, testing, CI/CD from day one

## **🏆 Vision for Success**

**Year 1 Goal**: Establish DART-Planner as the go-to open source solution for production-ready drone autonomy.

**Year 2 Goal**: Build sustainable community with regular contributors and commercial success stories.

**Year 3 Goal**: Become industry standard reference implementation, influencing how autonomous drones are built.

**The ultimate success**: When drone developers say *"Let's start with DART-Planner"* instead of *"Let's build from scratch."*
