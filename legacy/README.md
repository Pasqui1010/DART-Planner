# Legacy Code (Archived)

This directory contains **historical experiments and prototype implementations** that are no longer maintained.

* They are kept for reference only.
* No active modules in the DART-Planner codebase should import from `legacy/`.
* Content here may be removed in a future major release.

If you find an essential piece of functionality here, please open an issue so it can be ported to the active `src/` packages.
