# CI Workflow Consolidation & Enhancement

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline has been consolidated to reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and create a single source of truth for all quality checks. This document outlines the new structure and responsibilities of each workflow.

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. **quality-pipeline.yml** - Primary Quality Pipeline
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all PR checks and quality validation.

**Triggers**:
- All pushes to `main`, `develop`, and `feature/*` branches
- All pull requests to `main` and `develop` branches

**Jobs**:
- **quality-checks**: Code formatting, linting, type-checking, security audits, fast tests
- **security-scan**: Comprehensive security analysis with PR comments
- **e2e-tests**: End-to-end Playwright tests (PRs only)

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Unified dependency caching
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security scanning (pip-audit, safety, bandit)
- ‚úÖ Code quality enforcement (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- ‚úÖ Fast test suite with coverage reporting
- ‚úÖ Real-time latency validation
- ‚úÖ Gateway security testing
- ‚úÖ Audit compliance checks

### 2. **sitl_tests.yml** - SITL Testing Suite
**Purpose**: Software-In-The-Loop testing and simulation validation.

**Triggers**:
- All pushes and PRs (same as quality-pipeline)
- Daily scheduled runs at 2 AM UTC
- Manual triggers

**Jobs**:
- **unit-tests**: SITL-specific unit tests
- **mock-sitl-tests**: Mock SITL environment tests
- **airsim-sitl-tests**: Full AirSim integration tests (scheduled/conditional)

**Key Features**:
- üéØ Focused on simulation and hardware integration
- üïê Scheduled AirSim tests to avoid CI resource conflicts
- üìä Performance regression detection
- üîß Mock testing for fast feedback

### 3. **slow-suite.yml** - Comprehensive Test Suite
**Purpose**: Slow and integration tests that don't belong in PR checks.

**Triggers**:
- Weekly scheduled runs (Sundays at 3 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs**:
- **slow-tests**: Comprehensive test suite with coverage

**Key Features**:
- üêå Runs tests marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`
- üìà Coverage reporting for comprehensive analysis
- ‚è∞ Scheduled to avoid blocking PRs

### 4. **sim-suite.yml** - Simulation Stack Testing
**Purpose**: Simulation stack integration and performance testing.

**Triggers**:
- Pushes to `main` and `feature/*` branches
- Pull requests to `main`

**Jobs**:
- **software-in-the-loop-test**: Simulation stack integration tests

**Key Features**:
- üß™ Simulation stack initialization testing
- üîÑ Communication protocol validation
- ‚ö° Performance benchmarking
- üßπ Cleanup and shutdown testing

### 5. **Other Specialized Workflows**

#### **docs.yml**
- Documentation generation and validation
- Runs on pushes to main and PRs

#### **auto-format.yml**
- Automatic code formatting with black and isort
- Runs on pushes to main and PRs

#### **pr-demo-preview.yml**
- Demo preview generation for PRs
- Runs on pull requests only

#### **docker-release.yml**
- Docker image building and publishing
- Runs on releases and tags

## Migration Summary

### ‚úÖ **Consolidated into quality-pipeline.yml**:
- All linting and type-checking jobs
- Security scanning and auditing
- E2E Playwright tests
- Gateway security tests
- Fast test suite execution

### ‚úÖ **Removed Redundancy**:
- Deleted `e2e-playwright.yml` (integrated into quality-pipeline)
- Removed duplicate linting/type-checking from `sitl_tests.yml`
- Removed duplicate security tests from `sim-suite.yml`

### ‚úÖ **Maintained Separation**:
- SITL tests remain focused on simulation/hardware
- Slow tests remain separate to avoid blocking PRs
- Simulation stack tests remain specialized

## Benefits

### **For Developers**:
- **Single source of truth**: All quality checks in one place
- **Faster feedback**: Reduced redundancy means faster CI runs
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each workflow has a specific purpose
- **Better caching**: Unified dependency management

### **For Maintainers**:
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer workflows to maintain
- **Easier debugging**: Centralized quality checks
- **Better resource utilization**: Scheduled tests don't block PRs
- **Consistent standards**: Unified quality enforcement

### **For the Project**:
- **Improved reliability**: Less chance of conflicting checks
- **Better security**: Comprehensive security scanning in every PR
- **Faster development**: Reduced CI wait times
- **Clear documentation**: Well-defined workflow responsibilities

## Usage Guidelines

### **For Contributors**:
1. **PRs**: All quality checks run automatically via `quality-pipeline.yml`
2. **SITL changes**: Additional SITL tests run via `sitl_tests.yml`
3. **Simulation changes**: Simulation tests run via `sim-suite.yml`
4. **Slow tests**: Run weekly via `slow-suite.yml`

### **For Maintainers**:
1. **Quality enforcement**: Modify `quality-pipeline.yml` for new checks
2. **SITL testing**: Modify `sitl_tests.yml` for simulation changes
3. **Performance**: Use `slow-suite.yml` for comprehensive testing
4. **Documentation**: Update this file when workflow changes occur

## Configuration Files

### **Requirements**:
- `requirements/ci.txt`: Core CI dependencies
- `requirements/dev.txt`: Development dependencies
- `requirements/base.txt`: Base project dependencies

### **Quality Tools**:
- `.bandit`: Bandit security linter configuration
- `.flake8`: Flake8 linting configuration
- `mypy.ini`: MyPy type checking configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Black and isort configuration

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### **Key Metrics**:
- CI run times (should be faster after consolidation)
- Test coverage (maintained at 75% minimum)
- Security scan results (zero HIGH severity issues)
- Workflow success rates

### **Regular Tasks**:
- Review and update dependency versions
- Monitor security scan results
- Update workflow configurations as needed
- Maintain documentation accuracy
