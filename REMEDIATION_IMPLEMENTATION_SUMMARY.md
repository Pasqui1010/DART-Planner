## 🔄 In Progress

### 5. Expand Unit Tests to Cover Real-Time Jitter, DI Resolution, Crypto Rotation

**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED**

**Completed:**
- Real-time jitter tests in `tests/test_rt_control_extension.py`

- Crypto rotation tests in `tests/test_os_keyring_integration.py`

**Remaining:**
- Integration tests for real-time performance under load
- Stress tests for DI container with complex dependency graphs
- End-to-end crypto rotation tests with live systems

### 6. Slim Down CI and Raise Coverage Focus on High-Risk Modules

**Status: PLANNED**

**Current CI Analysis:**
- Quality pipeline runs comprehensive checks but may be slow
- Security scanning is thorough but could be optimized
- Test coverage targets need to be raised for high-risk modules

**Planned Improvements:**
- Split CI into fast/slow pipelines
- Focus coverage requirements on security and real-time modules
- Optimize test execution with parallelization
- Add performance regression testing

## 📋 Remaining Items

### 7. Modularize Oversized Files, Enforce Stricter Lint/Type Rules

**Status: PENDING**

**Identified Issues:**
- Some files exceed 1000 lines and need modularization
- Type hints need improvement in legacy code
- Linting rules could be stricter for security-critical code

**Planned Actions:**
- Break down large files into focused modules
- Add comprehensive type hints
- Enforce stricter linting for security modules
- Add security-focused linting rules

## 🚀 Low-Severity / Backlog Items

### Completed
- ✅ Added `keyring>=24.0.0` for OS keyring integration
- ✅ Added `cython>=3.0.0` for real-time extensions

### Pending
- Replace numpy shape comments with `numpy.typing.NDArray` type hints
- Add structured logging (JSON) with correlation IDs for multi-thread traces
- Harden exception boundaries—never let raw `Exception` propagate
- Document timing assumptions and safe operating frequencies in README
