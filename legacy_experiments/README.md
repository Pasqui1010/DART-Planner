# Legacy Experiment Scripts

This directory preserves *archived R&D notebooks and quick-and-dirty optimization scripts* that pre-date the current three-layer architecture.  

* They **are not executed** by the production pipeline or CI tests.
* The code here may rely on outdated APIs and is retained **for historical reference only**.
* Feel free to browse for context or inspiration, but any new development should live under `experiments/` or the main `src/` tree.
