"""Legacy package root.

This file ensures that sub-packages under the historical `src.*` namespace can
still be imported directly via their bare names (e.g. `import common`) even
before the new public shim `dart_planner` is imported.  This is required for
older modules and test suites that haven't been updated yet.
