# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for DART-Planner. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences to help future maintainers understand why certain design choices were made.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software project. They provide:

- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The results, both positive and negative
- **Implementation**: How it was implemented

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status
**Accepted/Proposed/Deprecated/Superseded** - YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
Why this decision was needed

## Decision
What was decided

## Consequences
### Positive
- Benefits of the decision

### Negative
- Drawbacks of the decision

### Risks
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies

## Implementation
How the decision was implemented

## Related ADRs
Links to related decisions

## References
Links to relevant documentation, code, or external resources
```

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Current ADRs

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](0001-configuration-consolidation.md) | Configuration System Consolidation | Accepted | 2024-12-19 |
| [ADR-0002](0002-di-container-design.md) | Dependency Injection Container Design | Accepted | 2024-12-19 |

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR file** with the next sequential number
2. **Use the template** above as a starting point
3. **Be specific** about the decision and its rationale
4. **Include code examples** when relevant
5. **Link to related ADRs** and documentation
6. **Update this README** with the new ADR

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when the decision:

- **Affects multiple components** or subsystems
- **Introduces new patterns** or architectural approaches
- **Changes the way dependencies** are managed
- **Impacts performance** or scalability
- **Affects the development workflow** or tooling
- **Introduces new technologies** or frameworks
- **Changes the deployment** or infrastructure approach

## Benefits

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Future developers understand why decisions were made
- **Consistency**: Helps maintain architectural consistency across the project
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the architecture
- **Refactoring**: Provides context when considering architectural changes
- **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of the system's evolution
