## 📊 **Cleanup Statistics**

- **Total Files Processed**: 19
- **Files Successfully Archived**: 18
- **Files Preserved**: 1 (duplicate entry handled)
- **Archive Size**: ~32 files total (including previous cleanup)

## 🧹 **Cleanup Process**

### Automated Script
Created `scripts/cleanup_obsolete_files.py` that:
- **Identifies obsolete files** based on naming patterns and content analysis
- **Preserves important files** (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, etc.)
- **Handles filename conflicts** by adding numeric suffixes
- **Creates comprehensive documentation** explaining what was archived and why
- **Supports dry-run mode** for safe testing

### Archive Organization
- **Location**: `archive/obsolete_files/`
- **Documentation**: Created `README.md` explaining the archive contents
- **Preservation**: All files preserved with original names and timestamps
- **Accessibility**: Easy to find and reference if needed
