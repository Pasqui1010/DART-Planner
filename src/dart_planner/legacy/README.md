# `src.legacy` Package (Deprecated)

This package stores legacy planners and modules that have been **superseded** by modern equivalents in `src/`.

They remain importable for backward-compatibility but will be removed after v1.0.
Dependents should migrate to the newer SE(3) MPC and associated utilities.
