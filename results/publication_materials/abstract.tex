This paper presents a breakthrough in real-time trajectory optimization for autonomous aerial vehicles, achieving a 2,496× performance improvement over existing methods. We identify and resolve a critical algorithm domain mismatch where DIAL-MPC (designed for legged robotics) was misapplied to aerial systems. Our optimized SE(3) Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation achieves 2.1ms average planning time with 100\% success rate, enabling real-time operation at 479Hz effective frequency.

Experimental results show our method achieves 100\% planning success compared to 25\% for the original DIAL-MPC approach, while reducing planning time from 5,241ms to 2.1ms. The system demonstrates robust real-time performance up to 100Hz replanning frequency, making it suitable for aggressive autonomous flight applications.
